Sockets are the "virtual" endpoints of any kind of network communications done between 2 hosts over in a network. When you type www.google.com in your web browser, it opens a socket and connects to google.com to fetch the page and show it to you; same with any chat client like gtalk or skype... any network communication goes through a socket. The socket api on linux is similar to bsd/unix sockets from which it has evolved. Although over time the api has become slightly different at few places. And now the newer official standard is posix sockets api which is same as bsd sockets.
